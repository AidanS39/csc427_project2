<s> Latest corporate unbundler reveals laid-back approach Roland Franklin who is leading a 697m pound break-up bid for DRG talks to Frank Kane </s>
<s> By FRANK KANE </s>
<s> IT SEEMS that Roland Franklin the latest unbundler to appear in the UK has made a fatal error in the preparation of his Â£697m break-up bid for stationery and packaging group DRG </s>
<s> He has not properly investigated the target 's dining facilities </s>
<s> The 63-year-old head of Pembridge Investments through which the bid is being mounted says rule number one in this business is the more luxurious the luncheon rooms at headquarters the more inefficient the business </s>
<s> If he had taken his own rule seriously he would have found out that DRG has a very modest self-service canteen at its Bristol head office </s>
<s> There are other things he has on his own admission not fully investigated like the value of the DRG properties or which part of the DRG business he would keep after the break up </s>
<s> When the bid was launched last week Mr Franklin faced some criticism from City commentators on both those counts </s>
<s> He regards the charges as unfounded </s>
<s> On property he is blunt </s>
